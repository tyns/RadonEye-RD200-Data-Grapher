# RadonEye RD200 Data Grapher

This project provides a tool to graph data from the RadonEye RD200 device. It can be run as a precompiled executable or as a Python script.

This program tries to fill the void of being able to understand the data points exported from your RD200 Monitor.  It will load the exported data points text file from your RD200 and then display them in a graph with date and time stamps.  This allows you to make sense of the data from your RD200 device.  You will no longer be guessing what year, month, day, hours data points were taken. Further, you will be able to zoom in and analyze any range of data points you require.

## Precompiled Versions
- **Mac**: Download `radon_plot.app` from the [Releases](https://github.com/tyns/RadonEye-RD200-Data-Grapher/releases) page (if available).
  - Double-click the `.app` file to run. No installation required.
- **Windows**: Download `radon_plot.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/tyns/RadonEye-RD200-Data-Grapher/releases) page (if available).
  - Double-click the `.exe` file to run. No installation required.

## Running from Source (Python Script)
If you prefer to run the Python script (`radon_plot.py`), follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `matplotlib` (for plotting)
  - `numpy` (for data handling)
  - `PyQt5` (for GUI support)
  - Install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip3 install matplotlib numpy PyQt5
    ```
  - Note: Check `radon_plot.py` for any additional dependencies and install them similarly (e.g., `pip3 install <library>`).

### Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tyns/RadonEye-RD200-Data-Grapher.git
     cd RadonEye-RD200-Data-Grapher
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP from the GitHub page and extract it.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal in the project folder.
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     python3 radon_plot.py
     ```
   - This software assumes your data files are stored in default exported filename convention (e.g., `IE08RE000863_20250731 164749.txt`) from the RadonEye RD200.  The software uses information from the filename to make assumption for plotting the radon graph. 

### Navigation
- When using the Selection Magnification, `Left Mouse Button` zooms in, `Right Mouse Button` zooms out

### Notes
- Ensure your RadonEye data files (e.g., `IE08RE000863_20250731 164749.txt`) are accessible to the script.
- For precompiled versions, check the Releases page for updates. Contributions or issues can be reported via GitHub.

- --USE AT YOUR OWN RISK--
- I make no guarantee to the accuracy of plotting data generated by this software. Consult with a professional Radon expert for professional advice.
- This software is in no way affiliated with Ecosense (makers of the RadonEye RD200).  This is simply an independant attempt to fill a short coming of the RD200 smart app software.
